# `.gitignore.d` Directory

## Purpose

This directory provides a centralized and flexible way to manage files and directories that should be ignored by Git. Instead of adding numerous specific rules to the root `.gitignore` file, you can simply place the items you want to ignore into a `.gitignore.d` directory.

## How It Works

The root `.gitignore` file contains rules that cause the contents of any directory named `.gitignore.d` to be ignored repository-wide.

Specifically, the relevant lines in the root `.gitignore` are:

```gitignore
# Ignore contents of any .gitignore.d directory
**/.gitignore.d/*

# But don't ignore .gitkeep files, so we can keep directories.
!.gitkeep

# And don't ignore this README file itself.
!/.gitignore.d/README.md
```

This configuration means:

1.  Any file or folder placed inside a directory named `.gitignore.d` will be ignored by Git.
2.  You can create a `.gitignore.d` directory anywhere in the repository to ignore local files specific to that location.
3.  The exceptions `!.gitkeep` and `!/.gitignore.d/README.md` allow for committing otherwise empty directories and this documentation file.

## Usage

To ignore a file or directory without modifying the main `.gitignore` files, you have two options:

1.  **Place it here:** Move or create the file/directory inside this `.gitignore.d` directory at the root of the repository.
2.  **Create another `.gitignore.d`:** You can create a new directory named `.gitignore.d` anywhere in your repository. Any content you place inside it will automatically be ignored.

This approach helps keep the project's main `.gitignore` file clean and provides a consistent pattern for managing temporary files, local configurations, or other un-tracked items.
